# **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (benign or malignant) with Feed Forward Neural Network**

## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for diagnosing breast cancer as benign or malignant using a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN).

## Dataset
The dataset has 1 CSV file named 'data.csv'.

- *https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic*

The Breast Cancer dataset used for this analysis contains features extracted from breast cancer cell images.
<br>The dataset is distributed as follows:
- benign (B): 357 instances
- malignant (M): 212 instances

## Project Structure
1. Data analysis and preprocessing.
2. Implementing feature selection.
3. Creating a new dataset with only the selected features.
4. Finding and analyzing the most impactful features from the previous fifteen.
5. Feature scaling.
6. Splitting the data into training and testing sets and creating the Feed Forward Neural Network model.
7. Evaluating the model.
8. Saving the model.
9. Conclusion.
