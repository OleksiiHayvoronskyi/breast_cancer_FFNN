## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for diagnosing
breast cancer as benign or malignant using a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN).


## Dataset

The dataset has 1 CSV file 'data.csv'.

                  *https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic*.

The Breast Cancer dataset used for this analysis contains features extracted from breast cancer cell images.
The dataset is distributed as follows:
- benign (B): 357 instances;
- malignant (M): 212 instances.


## Project Structure

Step 1. Data analysis and preprocessing.
Step 2. Implementing Feature Selection.
Step 3. Creating a new dataset with only the selected features.
Step 4. Find and analyze the most impactful features from the previous fifteen.
Step 5. Feature Scaling.
Step 6. Split the data into training and testing sets and create Feed Forward Neural Network the neural network model.
Step 7. Evaluating the Model.
Step 8. Saving the Model.
Step 9. Conclusion.
