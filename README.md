## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for diagnosing
breast cancer as benign or malignant using a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN).


## Dataset

The dataset has 1 CSV file 'data.csv'.

The Breast Cancer dataset used for this analysis contains features extracted from breast cancer cell images.
<br>The dataset is distributed as follows:
- benign (B): 357 instances;
- malignant (M): 212 instances.


## Project Structure

Step 1. Data analysis and preprocessing.
<br>Step 2. Implementing Feature Selection.
<br>Step 3. Creating a new dataset with only the selected features.
<br>Step 4. Find and analyze the most impactful features from the previous fifteen.
<br>Step 5. Feature Scaling.
<br>Step 6. Split the data into training and testing sets and create Feed Forward Neural Network the neural network model.
<br>Step 7. Evaluating the Model.
<br>Step 8. Saving the Model.
<br>Step 9. Conclusion.
